# test_github
This is a test place to learn the basics of GIT and GITHUB  
  
# Tasks to do for newcomers 
All of these tasks should be done using the cmd:  
	- Task 1: Create a new branch (branch 1)  
	- Task 2: Create a new file, add and commit this file to your branch.  
	- Task 3: Push your branch (local) to the remote git.  
	- Task 4: From your current branch, create a new branch (branch 2), and then a second new file. Add, commit, and push this branch 2.  
	- Task 5: Make a few pushes in the branch 2.  
	- Task 6: Checkout an old commit, for example, the first commit of branch 2. Check the different in the files between this commit and other later commits.  
	- Task 7: Checkout branch 1, see again the differences in the files.  
	- Task 8: Checkout branch 2, create a .gitignore file, create a file and put the name of this file into the .gitignore  
	- Task 9: Add, commit, push, and then see the list list of the modifications --> Understand the purpose of the .gitignore  
	- Task 10: Merge branch 2 to branch 1 (Try to to it in local). Push this merge to the remote.  
	- Task 11: Check these actions in the Github and understand the git tree.  
	
# Tasks to do (level 2):
These tasks is used to learn about cmake, make, and also the principle of a cpp project  
	- Task 1: Create a branch (dev), and push this branch to remote to initialize the branch.  
	- Task 2: Init a Cpp project with the following repos: include, src, CMakeList.txt.  
	- Task 3: Create hello_world.h and hello_world.cpp. The purpose of this project is to print out a "Hello World" in the terminal.  
	- Task 4: Create repo "build". Compile the hello_world project using CMake and make   
	- Task 5: Creat the .gitignore, and put the name of the required files in the .gitignore.  
	- Task 6: Add, Commit, push.  
	- Task 7: You can add more fonctions into the cpp project, for example a new class.
